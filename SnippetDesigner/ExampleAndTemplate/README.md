## How to use **Snippet Buddy**
----
1. Run the program (debug mode works fine)
2. Program will copy all folders and files inside the Snippets folder in this program\'s project

---

#### Clear Snippets-folder first!
> If you run it without clearing the folder, the snippets I've added are imported. Clear content of Snippets-folder if you don't want them.

---

## Tips

- If you want to install snippets to a non-default location, paste the other path in program startup
- You can choose to either overwrite or skip files if a file with the same name exists in the install location
- Check out the example:  
  `/ExampleAndTemplate/Example.snippet`   
  It contains commented explanations on creating snippets.  

- Copy the template (cmd/ctrl/other +  drag):**  
**  `/ExampleAndTemplate/Template.snippet`  
   It contains a basic setup that can be easily modified to your needs.
- Paste the template in  
  `/Snippets/`  
    .. rename the copy, and get right into making your snippet.

##### When you've made new snippets, run the program, and start using them right away.
